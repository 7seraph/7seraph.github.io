<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Hello, this is the main page of my projects.</p>

  <p> I will update this page as a "main hub" to navigate around. My plan is to put projects here to display (however, I don't have any projects at the moment).

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a Junior at UC San Diego studying Cognitive Science with Specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation.
    I believe that one can truly learn by doing, even if one makes mistakes. That's okay because learning is process. It doesn't happen overnight.</p>
    <p>I like hanging out with loved ones and traveling places around the world (although I've been in California the majority of my life...I would love to travel to a different country though!).</p>
    <p>Generally, I'm someone who tries to plan ahead and this would cause me to stress about the unknown. I guess you can call me an 'overthinker'. But my greatest passion is to help others in need, especially if it makes their day better. Volunteering is one thing that fulfills a sense of purpose in my life. </p>
