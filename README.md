Personal Projects and Overview

Hello, this is a site where I will post any personal projects. While it does not look nice,
I intend to practice each day and add something new to it.

I will create this from scratch and use skills that I have learned from various programming 
courses to improve my coding knowledge. I believe in the "Learn by doing" philosophy.
